<h2>SPRING BLOSSOMS.</h2>


<p>Here, for the infant minds, fair spring,<br />
Blossoms of bright truth we bring,<br />
Seeds of virtue there to sow,<br />
Ere a single weed can grow.</p>

<p>Here may you learn how sweet the bliss,<br />
To worship nature&#8217;s loveliness,<br />
Escaping through her flow&#8217;ry charm,<br />
Each thought or wish to do a harm.</p>

<p>For when the tender buds of truth,<br />
Expand within the minds of youth,<br />
They cast a bloom around the heart<br />
That will not but with life depart.</p>

<p>Then take these tender blossoms rare,<br />
Preserve their sweets with gentle care,<br />
And ev&#8217;ry day thro&#8217; life you&#8217;ll find<br />
New flowers blooming in your mind.</p>

<h2>MAN FRIDAY.</h2>


<p>This is Robinson Crusoe&#8217;s man,
whom he named Friday, because he fell
in with him on that day of the week.
When Man Friday first saw Robinson
Crusoe, he offered to be his servant;
he was accepted as such, and Crusoe
found him very useful, for having been
born in that desolate country where
Crusoe had been cast away, he was well
acquainted with the forms and customs
of the neighboring inhabitants, as well
as with all the secret caverns and other
mysterious places upon the islands.</p>

<p>He also relieved the solitude of poor
Crusoe much; for man, even though he
choose the life of a Hermit, soon finds
that the society of his fellows is necessary
to his happiness, and that the words
of the Almighty are as true now as in
the beginning&#8212;&#8220;It is not good for man
to be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>My shining needle! much I prize<br />
Thy tender form and slender size,<br />

Though when I first began to sew,<br />
Before thy proper use I knew,<br />
And often pricked my fingers too,<br />
<span class="i">A trial sore wert thou.</span><br />
Then speed thee on my needle bright,<br />
The love of thee makes labor light.</p>

<p>Oh, soon thy motions to control,<br />
In collar, wristband, button-hole,<br />
<span class="i">My ready hand attains;</span><br />
And with thee I can help to form,<br />
Full many a garment stout and warm,<br />
To shield from winter&#8217;s wind and storm,<br />
<span class="i">The aged and the blind.</span><br />
Then speed thee on my needle bright,<br />
The love of thee makes labor light.</p>

<h2>THE TWO DOVES.</h2>


<p>See Julia and her sister Jane,<br />
On the grass bed of velvet green,<br />
How each shows her care and love,<br />
For her sweet pet turtle dove.</p>

<p>Pillowed on their guiltless breast,<br />
Like a warm and living nest;<br />
They seem to draw an early sense,<br />
Of purity and innocence.</p>

<p>Fann&#8217;d by their soft and tender wings,<br />
A moral from their pressure springs;<br />
A wish in innocence to move,<br />
As gently as the peaceful dove.</p>

<p>Oh! ever may such living toys,<br />
Be the theme of childhood&#8217;s joys,<br />
And cultivate as years increase,<br />
The love of virtue, truth and peace.</p>

<h2>MY PRETTY POLLY.</h2>


<p>Better than hoop or doll,<br />
I love my pretty chattering poll,<br />
For tho&#8217; the creature mocks my words<br />
I know her mock&#8217;ry but a bird&#8217;s.</p>

<p>And while upon my neck she&#8217;ll loll,<br />
And screaming out, &#8220;Pretty Poll,&#8221;<br />
I learn from the sweet chattering elf,<br />
To not have too much tongue myself.</p>

<p>I learn how many girls there be,<br />
Who without thinking talk like she,<br />
And parrot like they ever chatter,<br />
When they should think of something better.</p>

<p>Thus while I hear her prattle words,<br />
I think that girls should not be birds,<br />
Nor like them waste their time so dear,<br />
In chattering everything they hear.</p>

<h2>THE NEW FROCK.</h2>


<p>Here is Elizabeth dressed in her new
frock, given to her by her mother, for
doing what she is bid like a good girl.</p>

<p>She looks as if she was dressed to pay
a visit to some of her friends; but I
hope she will not be proud, and get too
fond of going from home; she should
remember that her frock was made out
of the poor silk-worm&#8217;s winter house,
that her shoes were made out of the
skin of a goat, and the pearls about her
neck were drawn from the bottom of the
sea, and that unless she is pleasant, affectionate,
and kind, no body will like
her better for her new clothes. There
are some little girls who think because
they have a new frock on, that they are
better than others who are dressed in
common clothes, which is not at all right.</p>

<p>Behold him on the lonely isle,<br />

His vessel far away the while,<br />
<span class="i">And he to solitude is left.</span></p>

<p>His faithful dog alone is there,<br />

So willing all his grief to share,<br />

<p>The exile o&#8217;er his wide domain,<br />

<p>His country, friends, all, all are gone,<br />
<span class="i">No relative to cheer his woe&#8212;</span><br />
But there shall come a brighter morn,<br />
<span class="i">And to his native land he&#8217;ll go.</span></p>

<p>Who nourished me with fondest care,<br />
And bore me forth to take the air,<br />
And plucked me fruits and flowers rare,<br />
<span class="i8">My Mother.</span></p>

<p>Who daily, as I older grew,<br />
Still taught me lessons bright and true,<br />
And virtue&#8217;s path kept in my view,<br />
<span class="i8">My Mother.</span></p>

<p>Oh, may I truly, every year,<br />
Return with love and tender care,<br />
The blessings I from thee did share,<br />
